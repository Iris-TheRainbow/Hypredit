# Hypredit
Makes editing hyrprland files a little bit easier

##Configuration
Optionally, at `~/.config/hypredit/`, make a file named hypredit.conf.

This is your cofiguration file. By default, `nano` is used as the text editor and `~/.config/hypr/` is used
as the hypr conf directory. If you wish to use a different editor or your hypr conf files are elsewhere, you can
overide the default. Adding the line `editor = vim` would make the editor vim, for example. Adding the line
`hyprconf = ~/.hypr/` would look in `~/.hypr/` for hypr conf files.
